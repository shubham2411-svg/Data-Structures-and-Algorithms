## Objectives

- To improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- To gain a strong understanding of core data structures and algorithms.
- To showcase consistency and dedication to learning DSA.
- To prepare for technical interviews and coding competitions.

## Daily Practice Log

Here is a summary of my daily practice sessions:

| Date       | Problem Statement                          | Data Structure/Algorithm Used | Notes/Challenges                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2024-11-01 | Two Sum                                   | Array                         | First attempt at using hash maps.   |
| 2024-11-02 | Merge Two Sorted Lists                   | Linked List                   | Focused on pointer manipulation.     |
| 2024-11-03 | Binary Tree Inorder Traversal            | Tree                          | Worked on recursive vs iterative.    |
| ...        | ...                                       | ...                           | ...                                  |
